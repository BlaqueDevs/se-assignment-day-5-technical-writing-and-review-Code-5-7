### 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level shape how you present information?
Knowing if your readers are tech-savvy or not helps you decide how much detail to include and whether to use simple language or technical terms.

### 2. How can you tailor content for different audiences?
Use visuals, examples, or plain language for beginners, while providing technical details and advanced explanations for experts.

### 3. How can you gauge audience knowledge to avoid too much jargon?
Ask for feedback, research typical questions your audience asks, or assume a beginner level unless stated otherwise.

### 4. How do you make content accessible for non-technical readers?
Use simple language, add examples, and avoid unnecessary technical terms or complicated concepts.

### 5. Why use plain language instead of jargon?
Plain language is easier to understand and ensures your audience gets the message without frustration.

### 6. Examples of simplifying terms to improve understanding:
Instead of "initialize," say "start." Instead of "terminate," say "end." These simpler words are quicker to grasp.

### 7. How do examples and visuals help explain complex ideas?
They show concepts in action and make abstract ideas more concrete and relatable.

### 8. What types of visuals work best for technical information?
- **Diagrams** for showing systems or processes.
- **Charts** for data comparisons.
- **Screenshots** for step-by-step guides.

### 9. How do headings and subheadings improve readability?
They break content into sections, so readers can quickly find what they’re looking for and understand the structure.

### 10. Best practices for headings and subheadings:
Keep them clear, specific, and relevant. Use consistent formatting and make them easy to scan.

### 11. What should a README introduction include?
Explain what the product does, who it’s for, and how it solves a problem—all in one or two sentences.

### 12. How can you summarize a product’s purpose and features?
Focus on the biggest benefits. For example: "This app organizes your tasks and sends reminders to keep you on track."
